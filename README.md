# Obstacle Assault (Unreal Engine Project)

This is a simple third-person platformer built in Unreal Engine as part of tutorial.  
It features classic obstacle course mechanics and a bit of my own twist

## Gameplay Features

- Moving platforms that go up and down  
- Side-to-side sliding cubes  
- Rotating platforms
- **Custom addition**: a triggered elevator platform that only activates when the player steps on it
- A level layout with an unusual and interesting vertical design
